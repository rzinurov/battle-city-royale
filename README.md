# Battle City Royale

A tribute to [Battle City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_City) game, that was originally produced and published in 1985 by [Namco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namco) for [NES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System).
It's written in TypeScript using [Phaser](https://phaser.io/) game framework, and is based on [parcel template by Ourcade](https://github.com/ourcade/phaser3-parcel-template).

This is my first Phaser project and JavaScript is not my main area of expertise, therefore I am by no means claiming that the code is clean or efficient.
But in case if you find this repo helpful in any way, please give it a star.
Also, if you have any suggestions on how this repo can be improved, I'd be forever grateful if you could submit a PR or create an issue.
